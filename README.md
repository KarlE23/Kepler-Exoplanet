# Project objectives/hypotheses
To help me answer the main question, this project sets out to explore the Kepler Object of Interests (KOI) dataset using data analysis and machine learning. I want first to build a predictive model that can classify whether a KOI is likely to be a confirmed planet or a false positive. If the classification model is accurate, I want to go further and investigate which of the confirmed exoplanets might potentially be habitable.
But before we can do any modeling, the dataset must undergo proper preprocessing. This could include checking for and handling missing values, cleaning the columns and their formats, and preparing the data for analysis. Once the dataset has been cleaned and stored in a structured MySQL schema, each column (feature) will be individually explored to better understand its meaning, data type, and distribution.
After exploring columns individually, we will continue with our EDA more in-depth. We will combine columns that may be most related to finding real planets vs. false planets. This will help uncover relationships between variables, assess the balance of class labels (e.g. confirmed vs. false positive), and identify any patterns or anomalies. This process can maybe help ensure a solid foundation for the machine learning phase, allowing the models to learn from meaningful data.
The objective of this project is therefore:
To develop predictive models to classify Kepler Objects of Interest as either confirmed exoplanets or false positives and to predict the potential habitability of confirmed exoplanets.
To guide this investigation, the following secondary research questions will be addressed:
1.	Which physical and orbital characteristics most strongly influence whether a KOI is classified as a confirmed exoplanet or a false positive?
2.	How accurately can machine learning models predict whether a KOI is a confirmed exoplanet based on its observed properties?
3.	What set of criteria based on planetary and stellar properties can be used to define potential habitability among confirmed exoplanets?
4.	How effectively can machine learning models identify potentially habitable exoplanets among the confirmed exoplanet population using Kepler data?
As the project explores these goals and questions, it doesnâ€™t just aim to use ML to sort planets, it also hopes to better understand the conditions in space that might allow habitable planets. By carefully cleaning the data, looking at each column, and training the models, this study uses the Kepler dataset as a way to search for other worlds that might be a little like Earth.
